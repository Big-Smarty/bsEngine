# bsEngine
My own shitty vulkan engine made with sdl, vulkan (obviously) and a shit ton of other libraries. also c++20 modules coming soon. Little of it really comes from my own, Im just following vkguide.dev and rewriting it to be more object oriented. Dont ask me if you have any issues with vulkan, I myself barely know what the hell I am doing,
